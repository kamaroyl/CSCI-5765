# Lab 3 - Link State Router

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate the algorithm used to find the shortest path to all other nodes in the network.

Specifically we were to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for a graph represented by a file.

## To Make
Simply run `make`, the required executable  will be available in the out directory, which is created if it does not exist

## To Run
* `out/linkStateRouting ${File Location} ${Starting Node} ${Optional Debug Boolean Flag}`

e.g.

 `out/linkStateRouting Data/test10nodes 7`
